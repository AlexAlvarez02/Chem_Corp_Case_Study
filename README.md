Scenario Overview:

As	a	leading	producer	of	chemicals,	ChemCorp	has	observed	that	market	demand
has	been	strong	over	the	past	few	years	with	growth	averaging	7%	Year-on-Year.	As	a
Fortune	500	corporation,	this	is	impressive	growth	and	has	led	to	continual	operation
and	distribution	center	expansions	across	48	states	in	the	US.	With	favorable	growth
rates	and	lowered	barriers	to	entry	due	to	government	regulation,	this	has	attracted
increased	competition.	New	startups	are	offering	optimized	delivery	channels	for
chemicals;	a	few	companies	have	started	using	new	technologies	like	machine
learning	and	artificial	intelligence	to	create	new	chemicals	and	lower	the	production
costs	for	existing	chemicals.

ChemCorp	didn’t	think	these	competitors	were	a	primary	concern	until	recently	when
discussions	with	five	long-term	customers	revealed	that	ChemCorp	was	no	longer
these	firms’	preferred	provider	of	chemicals.	After	these	customers	left,	the	sales
management	team	found	that	~	10%	of	sales	revenue	came	from	these	customers.
ChemCorp’s	management	team	immediately	drafted	an	action	plan,	pulling	together
a	team	from	Commercial,	Strategy	and	Business	Analytics	to	tackle	this	issue.	If	this
trend	were	to	continue	unchecked,	ChemCorp’s	market	share	and	potential
customer-base	would	gradually	erode,	damaging	the	board’s	confidence	in	existing
management.	This	unchecked	trend	could	also	indicate	a	potential	risk	in	the
company’s	ability	to	make	dividend	payments	to	shareholders	if	losses	prove	to	be
too	steep.

ChemCorp’s	current	portfolio	includes	six	primary	industries	and	eleven	different
chemical	products.	These	industries	and	chemicals	are	listed	below:

Industries
● Aerospace	Defence
● Biotechnology
● Machinery	and	Industrial	Goods
● Medical	Equipment
● Paper	and	Packaging
● Pharmaceuticals


Chemicals
● Chemical	A	(Speciality)
● Chemical	B
● Chemical	C
● Chemical	D
● Chemical	E
● Chemical	F
● Chemical	G	(Speciality)
● Chemical	H
● Chemical	I
● Chemical	J	(Speciality)
● Chemical	K


Management	has	concluded	that	to	best	address	the	loss	of	customers	and	protect
the	existing	market	share,	an	immediate	short-term	action	plan	needs	to	be	drafted.
